# Description
This repository includes the codes and notebooks to simulate a dynamic system determined by a user and estimate and analyze the contributions (weight) of each process involved in the dynamics based on a specified observational time.

# Folders
+ `examples`: Folder containing examples of models in JSON format. These models can be used as inputs and to implement other models with a different number of variables, processes, and parameters.
+ `first_time_Colab_test`: Folder containing the outputs to be compared with the execution of the Colab notebook when testing it for the first time on a browser.
+ `test`: Folder containing files relevant to the (ongoing) testing process of the repository.

# Files
+ `LICENSE`: This text file specifies the repository's licensing details.
+ `README.md`: This text file provides the repository's main description and content. It is the file you are currently reading.
+ `dynamic_regimes.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code to execute the current dynamics version. It includes a link to execute it as a Colab notebook.
+ `legacy_code_PerCapFiniT.py`: This Python file contains code that could help repurpose some parts of the current method implemented in the Jupyter Notebook.

# How to obtain results
In the current version, the methodology has been implemented in a [Colab notebook](https://github.com/luquelab/dynamics/blob/Colab/dynamic_regimes.ipynb), which includes a Quick-Start Guide.

# Acknowledgements
The notebook is based on ongoing research on transient dynamics by the [Luque lab](https://www.luquelab.com/) and [Rohwer lab](https://coralandphage.org/) with scientists [Sergio Cobo-Lopez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m6m1HV4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matthew Witt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-witt-45b37159/) as first authors of the foundational research contribution. PI [Antoni Luque](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ytvnI68AAAAJ&hl=en) led the development of the [Colab notebook software](https://github.com/luquelab/dynamics).
